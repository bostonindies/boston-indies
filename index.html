    <div class="about">
        <p>Boston Indies is a community of independent game developers in Massachusetts supporting hobbyists, professionals, artists, academics, and anyone else interested in the craft of game creation.

        <p>Our goals are to: 
        <ul><li>Foster a sense of community among Bostonâ€™s independent game creators.</li>
        <li>Encourage creating games independent of large budgets and major corporations.</li>
        <li>Serve as a brain trust for local independent developers and create a positive environment for learning and getting critical feedback.</li></ul>

        <p>We are completely agnostic with respect to technology, development platform, game type, and scope of game development. As long as you show up with an open mind, helpful attitude, and you are committed to making your own games, on your own terms, you are welcome to join us!
