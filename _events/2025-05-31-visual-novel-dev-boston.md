Note: This event is **not run by Boston Game Dev**; we're just helping spread the word. Contact [vndev.boston@gmail.com](mailto:vndev.boston@gmail.com) if you have questions!

Come hang out with your fellow visual novel developers! This is a casual gathering where you can meet and chat with peers and talk about our processes, plans, and things we have learned from working on VNs. Developers of all parts of the VN development process are welcome, including but not limited to: art, writing, design, audio, music, programming, UI, marketing, and more.

​There is no set topic or presentation for this meetup, so feel free to bring your questions, ideas, works-in-progress, or just yourself~

​If you have an appreciation for VN but work on other, related genres, like point and click adventures, interactive fiction, CYOA, kinetic novels, or any other similar feeling narrative driven genre, feel free to join, we would love to have you!

​If you have any questions, please email [vndev.boston@gmail.com](mailto:vndev.boston@gmail.com)

How to find us: The day of the event we will grab a table at Bow Market with a small sign for the meetup.

​Bow Market features several food and drink vendors if you would like to purchase something for yourself to enjoy during the meetup. There are also bathrooms for public use.
