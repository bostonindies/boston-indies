Did you make the best game ever at Global Game Jam? Have you been toiling away on your passion project? Do you think publishers should be lining up around the block for the opportunity to throw piles of money your way? How about you pretend that's the case even if you know this is facetious and join our PreGDC Game Pitch?

Hone your skills by making a pitch deck for your game and tell an esteemed panel of experts why you deserve their money to launch your game. You will get what you put into this exercise.

If you're never pitched before, think about including the following:

What is your game?
(What makes it unique?)

- What is the market for your game?
  Demographic?
  Comparable titles?
- What is your budget?
- What is your timeline?
- Why are you the team for this?

Also, think about NOT pitching the following:

- Every details about your deep lore.
- A list of characters and their abilities.
  (Exception: Every character is a celebrity.)
- 10 slides about each small feature of gameplay.

Each group will be allotted 15 minutes to pitch their game on the big screen at Aeronaut Brewing. You'll get feedback and enjoy drinks with friends.

See you there!
