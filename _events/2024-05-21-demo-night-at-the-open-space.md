Come show off the game you're working on, or just come kick it and see what folks in the community are up to! Hang out and support your fellow game makers with some feedback, informal play testing, and encouragement.

No sign-up required; if you have something to show, just bring a laptop/tablet to play on! The venue has power but WiFi is a little spotty, so be prepared for that.

This season of Boston Indies is sponsored by Snoozy Kazoo! Snoozy Kazoo is a local indie know for Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion, as well as their brand new title, Turnip Boy Robs a Bank! Go check them out on their [official website](https://snoozykazoo.com/)!!!
