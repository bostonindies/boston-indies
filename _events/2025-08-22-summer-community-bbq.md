Let's spring into summer! Come celebrate the longest day of the year with us at the **Boston Game Dev** Summer BBQ on Sunday June 22th, 11am-3pm!

As springtime pollen fades and summer birds call, come join us as we swap May flowers days for June bugs! Join us for a community BBQ at **Danehy Park**! Hang with all your fav local game makers, chat about what cool games you're makin', and get your chomp on. Thanks to our sponsor **Devolver Digital**, we'll have some tasty food from Blue Ribbon BBQ. However, please bring more to share!

Note that this is a public park and **alcohol is not allowed**. If you bring anything homemade, please note any allergens. We will also NOT be allowed to use the grills this year, so any food will need to be pre-cooked.
