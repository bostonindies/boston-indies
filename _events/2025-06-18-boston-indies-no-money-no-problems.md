What is it like to make games with no money? What is it like to publish games with (basically) no money? For the past 5 years with the indie game anthology Indiepocalypse, Andrew has done just that.

In this talk Andrew will discuss working in the world of no-budget DIY games and how doing that actually makes traveling to cons and tabling a big show like PAX East possible.

After the talk, we'll roll over to Flat Top Johnny's for pinball and drinks and chit chattin'
