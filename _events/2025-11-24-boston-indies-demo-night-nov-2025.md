Come show off the game you're working on, or just come kick it and see what folks in the community are up to! Hang out and support your fellow game makers with some feedback, informal play testing, and encouragement.

No sign-up required; if you have something to show, just bring a laptop/tablet to play on! The venue has power and WiFi, but you might want to bring a power strip or extension cable just in case.

We'll be in the back, the 'Food Hub' area. From the entrance, turn left and go down the big hallway. Or when you arrive you can check in with the staff and let them know you're there for Boston Indies, and they can direct you to where we'll be if you aren't familiar with the venue.
