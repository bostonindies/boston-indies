Come show off the game you're working on, or just come kick it and see what folks in the community are up to! Hang out and support your fellow game makers with some feedback, informal play testing, and encouragement.

No sign-up required; if you have something to show, just bring a laptop/tablet to play on! The venue has power but WiFi is a little spotty, so be prepared for that.
