Boston Indies presents **A New Kind of Driving Game: A Chat with Pacific Drive Game Director Seth Rosen**

Join us for an interview and Q&A with the game director of the recent hit Pacific Drive! We'll be joined by Seth Rosen, Game Director, and Bryant Francis, Senior Editor at Game Developer. We'll be talking about the development process for Pacific Drive, Seth's design ethos, and taking audience questions.

**Please note that MIT locks their exterior doors at 7pm, which is when the talk will begin.** If you are late, you'll need to use MIT's Tim Tickets app to enter the building, or message an event organizer to let you in. Instructions are below.

Pacific Drive is available now on Steam, Epic Game Store, and PS5
